# Welcome to my portfolio website!

You can use this template to build your own one-page style website. I prefer to use an one-page style website since it's not optimal to share your blog, portfolio, and projects in a website. It requires too much effort!

# Resources & Alternatives
- This repo is templated from [here](https://github.com/timothygebhard/minimal-academic-website).
- If you need a more advanced website, you can check [Academic Pages](https://academicpages.github.io/).
- For icons I used [ionicons](https://ionic.io/ionicons). Site also has pre-made HTML code for icon usage. It's begginner friendly!
